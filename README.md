# VIM Plugins

This repository is here to keep trap of my `.vim/plugins/`, witch I create or found.

## nextzz.vim

This one launch a `zz` command in normal mode when you search next or previous term with `n` or `N` if the corresponding line is not currently visible (so you don't have to scroll anymore)

Very usefull.
